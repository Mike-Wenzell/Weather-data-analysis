# Project: Weather data analysis
Analysing historical data with python.


## Overview

The objective is to understand weather data through data collected in different cities: Berlin, Milan, Hotan (China), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Sczeczin (Poland)


## Process followed

### Librairies used

- pandas
- os
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- seaborn 
- scipy.stats

### Steps

- Defining what output and analysis to conduct
- Clean the data
- Wrangle the data into different dataframes
- Start the analysis on one city, Berlin, and create plots to illustrate it
- Adapt the analysis to a data pipeline adaptable to all cities
- Test a few different hypothesis based on the data collected

## Results

- A complete clean dataframe saved as a CSV
- A dataframe for the city studied saved as a CSV
- Several graphs describing the evolution of the average, minimum and maximum temperature per decade, and correlation matrix between temperature parameters.
